# Titanic-data
## Overview
The data has been split into two groups: training set (train.csv) and test set (test.csv)
** The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Our model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. 

** The test set should be used to see how well  model performs on unseen data. For the test set, there is not provided ground truth for each passenger. It is our job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, we use the model we trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
